      <h1>"Psychedelic"</h1>
      <p>This page is a tribute to one of the most amazing, dynamic individuals I have ever known.  It has been over a year since my good friend Pat's life was cut short by a heart attack.  Not a day goes by that I don’t think about him and his impact on my life as well as the countless others he inspired.</p>

      <p> This photo is my last day I ever spent with Pitter, we hiked up the hill to overlook Salt Lake City and talked as we always did about life, careers and the struggles of how to be happy.</p>

      <p>Psychedelic was the last word Pat sent to our group text.</p>

      <p>The day I learned Pat had passed away </a>, it didn’t really hit me until later that night and I broke down in tears.  I was humbled and honored when Pats family asked me to speak at his <a href="http://www.lindquistmortuary.com/notices/Patrick-Parkinson">Celebration of Life</a>.

      <img src="./assets/img/sahbu.jpg" alt="">

      <p>Pat was a journalist at heart and had a thurst for finding the truth. Pitter was not afraid to ask tough questions no matter who he was interviewing. In 2013 Pat teamed up with <a href="http://sahbu.org/cause/" target="_blank">Sahbu</a> founder Mitch Weight to help with devestating situtation for children in Liberia.  They embarked on a trip to Liberia to attempt to bring to light the many issues including 80% of school age girls have turned to prostituion, and 66% of girls 10-19 have been raped.</p>
