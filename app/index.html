      <h1>"Psychedelic"</h1>
      <p>This page is a tribute to one of the most amazing, dynamic individuals I have ever known.  It has been over a year since my good friend Pat's life was cut short by a heart attack.  Not a day goes by that I donâ€™t think about him and his impact on my life as well as the countless others he inspired.</p>

      <p> This photo is my last day I ever spent with Pitter, we hiked up the hill to overlook Salt Lake City and talked as we always did about life, careers and the struggles of how to be happy.</p>

      <p>Psychedelic was the last word Pat sent to our group text.</p>
